# Scavengers

This project is based on the Intermediate-level tutorial for Unity3D.
I extended the very basic movements of the enemies to avoid obstacles.
The game's camera behaviour has been adapted to handle mobile devices screen-rotation.
I configured the player for IOS devices to handle in a compatible way to IOS the sprites texture compression (by disabling compression).
